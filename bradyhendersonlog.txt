For this project, I primarily worked on the GUI, and the overall user experience when playing our Yahtzee Game.

Specific Contributions
    - Picked the color scheme for the application
    - Created the init() function, which initializes and creates all swing/GUI components (Except for Rules)
    - Created all Action Listener functions for each respective button
    - Handled the layout of the components
    - Created functions show(), Game(), mainMenu(), gameScreen(), toggleScoreButtonsOff(), toggleScoreButtonsOn(), resetButtonText(), handleEndTurn(), showScore(), checkYahtzee()
